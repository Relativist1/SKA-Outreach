Install using the installer.

### Linux Users (Ubuntu)

Linux users can install Jupyter Notebook without installing Anaconda in your Linux system (Ubuntu). The following steps can be followed to install. If you have already installed pip, skip to step 2.

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip

* Now type the following command
```bash
pip install notebook
```
